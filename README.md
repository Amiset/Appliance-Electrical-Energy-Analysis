# ANALYSIS AND PREDICTIVE MODELLING OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY APPLIANCES IN SMALL HOMES
### 1. Introduction
1.1 Centre for Policy Research India states (Centre for Policy Research, 2017) that electricity consumption in Indian homes has increased 50 times between today and 1971. Residential electricity now outpaces growth in industrial, commercial and agriculture sectors. This striking statistic is on the increase, as India moves towards one of the largest urban transitions in history in the coming decades.
1.2 It is a fact that improving access to affordable modern energy is critical to improving living standards in the country. The electricity demand of a nation speaks of its social standard, pace of economic growth, geographical variations and demography of the population at large. Thus, as the country treks on a path to human resource development, the electrical demand in India will increase. Understanding and forecasting of electrical load characteristics have been complex due to its dependency on large number of factors which affects it i.e. weather condition, geographical diversity, sunrise/sunset times, seasonal diversity etc. The detailed study of the electricity consumption invokes a knowledge of its trend and seasonality which can be exploited to extrapolate the demand characteristics. (Kajal Gaur, 2016). This report attempts at analyzing the electrical requirements of an average house so as to provide a basis for analyzing the overall residential demand of electricity.

### 2. Problem Statement/ Motivation
2.1 The scale of increased residential demand, the uncertainty in the extent to which it could increase, and the urban and demographic transitions underway make future electricity needs immense. If unaddressed, this demand will put serious constraints on already stretched national resources, posing serious social, local environmental and climate change related burdens. 
2.2 More importantly, demand-side interventions could substantially reduce the requirements of energy supply, bypass the structural inefficiencies and financial losses prevalent
in electricity distribution, and shape path-dependent consumption trajectories.
2.3 It would be prudent to understand in detail the factors which affect consumption in average households. The analysis of consumption of electrical energy by appliances within small households in relation to temperature, humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure so as to determine their effect on demand within a small household may provide an insight into requirements of electric generation at the regional and national level. Moreover, the understanding of these factors will help accrue advantages not only at the generation side but also at the consumer side through cost savings

### 3. Objective
3.1 To carry out an analysis of the factors affecting electrical consumption in a small household in order to:-
(a) Study energy consumption behavior of consumers in a small household.
(b) Analyze the appliance energy consumption relation with factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure as prevalent inside a house.
(c) Develop a supervised learning model using regression algorithms thus provide information to consumer about the energy consumption by appliances so as to assist in reduction of electrical consumption.
